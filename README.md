# React-TodoList-Mobx

* Reactjs

This project is an example created in the [Mobx Official Page](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html) that have been modified by me. This project has been developed to practice my skills with the tech stack shown above.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Use mobx with create-react-app

Proper way of installing mobx when you are using create-react-app is as follows:

1. create-react-app ExampleApp
2. npm run eject
3. npm install --saveDev babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy
4. Update your .babelrc file or package.json and added transform-decorators-legacy

    ```
    "babel": {
        "presets": [
          "react-app"
        ],
        "plugins": [
          "transform-decorators-legacy"
        ]
      }
    ```
    
5. npm install --save mobx mobx-react

Another option: use [custom-react-scripts](https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts)


## Running

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of React concepts. You must also already have create-react-app installed on your machine.

To run it, cd into `react-todolist-mobx` and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start or npm start
```

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
